Overview of Steps
1. Create a Directory and Configuration File
Start by creating a directory for your Terraform project. Inside this directory, create a Terraform configuration file, typically named main.tf. In this file, define the AWS provider and the resources you want to create. Below is a basic example:

hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Set your desired AWS region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Specify an appropriate AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
2. Initialize Terraform
Navigate to the directory containing your Terraform configuration files using your terminal. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform working directory, which will download any necessary provider plugins:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
3. Plan the Configuration
Before applying the changes, itâ€™s good practice to generate a plan. This step allows you to preview what Terraform will do before making any changes to your infrastructure. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
Terraform will display a detailed plan outlining the actions it will take to achieve the desired state described in your configuration file.

4. Apply the Configuration
Once you've reviewed the plan and are satisfied with the proposed changes, apply the configuration by running:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the execution by typing "yes". After confirmation, it will proceed to create the AWS resources as defined in your Terraform configuration.

5. Verify the Resources
After Terraform has completed the provisioning process, you can verify the resources in the AWS Management Console or by using AWS CLI commands to ensure everything was created as expected.

6. Destroy the Resources
If you need to remove the resources created by Terraform, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
Be cautious with this command, as it will delete all the resources specified in your Terraform configuration.
