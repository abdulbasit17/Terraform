Using .tfvars Files in Terraform
In Terraform, .tfvars files are used to provide specific values for input variables defined in your configuration files. They help manage and organize configuration values separately from your main Terraform code, making it easier to handle different environments and sensitive data.

Purpose of .tfvars Files
Separation of Configuration from Code:

Maintainability: Input variables are designed to be configurable. .tfvars files allow you to keep these values separate from your main configuration files (.tf files), making your Terraform code cleaner and easier to manage.
Environment-Specific Configurations: You can create different .tfvars files for various environments (e.g., dev.tfvars, staging.tfvars, prod.tfvars), allowing you to apply the same Terraform code with different sets of values.
Sensitive Information:

Security: .tfvars files are a common place to store sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, and other secrets. Keeping these values out of version control reduces the risk of accidental exposure.
Reusability:

Flexibility: With .tfvars files, you can reuse the same Terraform modules and configurations across different projects or environments by simply changing the values in your .tfvars files.
Collaboration:

Personalized Configurations: In team settings, each member can have their own .tfvars file with configurations specific to their environment or workflow, reducing conflicts and streamlining development.
How to Use .tfvars Files
Define Input Variables:

Define your input variables in your Terraform configuration file (e.g., variables.tf):

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "EC2 AMI ID"
  type        = string
}
Create .tfvars Files:

Create .tfvars files to provide values for these variables (e.g., dev.tfvars):

instance_type = "t2.medium"
ami_id         = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
Apply Configuration with .tfvars Files:

When running Terraform commands, specify the .tfvars file using the -var-file option:
sh
Copy code
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
Summary
Define variables in your Terraform code (e.g., variables.tf).
Create .tfvars files to provide specific values.
Use the -var-file option to apply configurations with different sets of values.
By using .tfvars files, you enhance the flexibility, security, and maintainability of your Terraform configurations.
