Provider Configuration
In Terraform, the required_providers block is used to declare the necessary providers for your module or configuration. This block specifies the provider name, its source, and version constraints to ensure compatibility and proper functioning of your Terraform setup.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to configure multiple providers using the required_providers block:


terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">= 2.0, < 3.0"
    }
  }
}
Explanation:
source: Specifies the location from which Terraform will download the provider. For example, "hashicorp/aws" indicates the AWS provider maintained by HashiCorp.
version: Defines the version constraints for the provider. For instance, "~> 3.0" means any version from 3.0 up to (but not including) 4.0. Similarly, "2.0, < 3.0" means any version from 2.0 up to (but not including) 3.0.
This configuration ensures that Terraform uses the correct versions of the providers, helping to maintain compatibility and stability in your infrastructure provisioning.
